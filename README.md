# Regression-Model
Using practice data to build a linear repression model to help an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing improve business. They sell online but  also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

Goal is to determine whether to focus the company's efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.
